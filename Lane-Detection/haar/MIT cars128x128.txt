        Cars
        ----

        The database of color car images was generated from video sequences
        taken in Boston and Cambridge over the course of a couple of days in
        1999. Our goal was to demonstrate the rapid portability of the
        trainable object detection system described in [2], [3] to a new
        domain; this data was used in [1], [4], [5]. The pose of the cars in
        the dataset is limited to frontal and rear views.

        Each image was extracted from raw data and was scaled to the size
        128x128 and aligned so that the car was in the center of the image;
        the size of the cars is such that the front or rear bumper is
        approximately 64 pixels across.

        The data is presented without any normalization; for details on how
        these images were processed, see the publications below.
